// Naming Variables. Cannot use a reserved word and use a meaningful descriptive word.
// Also can not start with a number. Cannot contain space or -
// Case sensitive. Use Camel notation.
// Declaring two variables. Best practice is to declare them in separate lines
// let name = 'Gaby';
// let lastName = 'Rios';

let name = 'Gaby';// string literal
let age = 30; // Number Literals
let isApproved = false; // Boolean Literal
let firsName = undefiled; // When you do not set any value is undefined, but also you can set
                         // a value to undefined. A name of a variable can be set to undefined.
let selectedColor = null; // when we want to clear value of a variable use null. null is object.
